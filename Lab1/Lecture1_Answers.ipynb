    "The first generation language is `machine language`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Machine language makes fast and efficient use of the computer.\n",
    "- It requires no translator to translate the code. It is directly understood by the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "It's hard to use because\n",
    "- All operation codes have to be remembered\n",
    "- All memory addresses have to be remembered.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second generation language is `assembly language`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "- Assembly language is easier to understand and use as compared to machine language.\n",
    "- It is easy to locate and correct errors.\n",
    "- It is easily modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "- Like machine language, it is also machine dependent/specific.\n",
    "- Since it is machine dependent, the programmer also needs to understand the hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "A high-level language is a programming language such as C, Python, and Java that enables a programmer to write programs that are more or less independent of a particular type of computer. Such languages are considered high-level because they are closer to human languages and further from machine languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "- High-level languages are user-friendly. They are similar to English and use English vocabulary and well-known symbols\n",
    "- They are easier to learn and maintain.\n",
    "- The language is independent of the machine on which it is used i.e. programs developed in a high-level language can be run on many different computer systems.\n",
    " \n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "- A high-level language has to be translated into the machine language by a translator, which takes up time\n",
    "- The object code generated by a translator might be inefficient compared to an equivalent assembly language program\n",
